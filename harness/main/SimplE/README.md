Summary
=======

This is a faster implementation of the model proposed in [SimplE Embedding for Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7682-simple-embedding-for-link-prediction-in-knowledge-graphs) for knowledge graph embedding. It can be also used to learn `SimplE` models for any input model. The software can be also used as a framework to implement new knowledge graph embedding models.


## Dependencies

* `Python` version 3.6
* `Numpy` version 1.15.4
* `PyTorch` version 1.0.0

## Usage

To run SimplE you should define the following parameters:

`ne`: number of epochs

`lr`: learning rate

`reg`:l2 regularization parameter

`dataset`: The dataset you want to run SimplE on

`emb_dim`: embedding dimension

`neg_ratio`: number of negative examples per positive example

`batch_size`: batch size

`save_each`: validate every k epochs

* Run `python main.py -ne ne -lr lr -reg reg -dataset dataset -emb_dim emb_dim -neg_ratio neg_ratio -batch_size batch_size -save_each save_each`


Running a model `M` on a dataset `D` will save the embeddings in a folder with the following address:

    $ <Current Directory>/models/D/

As an example, running the `SimplE` model on `wn18` will save the embeddings in the following folder:

    $ <Current Directory>/models/wn18/
    

## Reproducing the Results in the Paper

In order to reproduce the results presented in the paper, you should run the following commands:

### WN18

RUN `python main.py -ne 1000 -lr 0.1 -reg 0.03 -dataset WN18 -emb_dim 200 -neg_ratio 1 -batch_size 1415 -save_each 50`

### FB15K

RUN `python main.py -ne 1000 -lr 0.05 -reg 0.1 -dataset FB15K -emb_dim 200 -neg_ratio 10 -batch_size 4832 -save_each 50`
